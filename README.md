# RobotsVsDinos_Proj
In this project i created different classes of objects.
The Robot class and Dinosaur class will build their own objects.
Those objects will then be added to the Herd, if they are Dinosaur objects, or to the Fleet if they are Robot objects.
There is a weapon class to give the robot a weapon to fight with.
The battlefield class is where the Herd and Fleet come together to battle.
